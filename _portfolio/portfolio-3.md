## Project Overview

Developed a centralized database and standardization system to unify error codes and signals from wind turbines of different manufacturers, including Gamesa and Siemens. This solution enables technicians in the field to access a consistent, manufacturer-agnostic error code system, improving troubleshooting efficiency and reducing downtime. Key features include real-time data retrieval, mapping of proprietary error codes to standardized equivalents, and a user-friendly interface for field technicians. The system enhances operational reliability by streamlining diagnostics across diverse turbine models.
