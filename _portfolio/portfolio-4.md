Developed a Docker-integrated microservice utilizing LLM Models from OpenAI and Azure Speech Services to transcribe and diarize speakers from lengthy audio recordings of town hall meetings (or any other meeting). Implemented features include generating a summarized text, key points, a verbatim transcript, and various other functionalities, all compiled into a Word document.
