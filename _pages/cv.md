###  **Softinsa - IBM**
##### 2023-Current


  ### Projects

##### EasyInterview
###### Tech Stack : Python, Flask, React, Tailwind, Docker, Kubernetes(rancher), Pipelines, MongoDB, AzureAD, Single-Sign On

    Developed AI software to revolutionize IBM Softinsa's technical
    interview process. This project integrates generative language
    models to create exams on demand. It features a user-friendly
    portal and a dashboard that facilitates the generation of tests with
    randomized questions of varying difficulty levels and topics.
    Interviewee assessments are conducted automatically.

##### Devops
    I designed and implemented CI/CD pipelines to streamline deployment workflows. The pipelines build and push Docker images to Harbor for image hosting, then trigger SonarQube for static code analysis. Upon successful review, the images are deployed to QA and Production environments on Rancher (Kubernetes).

    Designed and developed a SaaS platform enabling users to upload and query various file types (PDFs, Word documents, audio, and images) using an AI assistant. Leveraged LangChain for data processing and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), integrating OpenAI's LLM models for contextual understanding. Built a scalable Python (FastAPI/Flask) backend to handle file processing, embedding generation, and conversational AI. Optimized PostgreSQL/Vector DBs (FAISS, ChromaDB, Weaviate) for semantic search and ensured secure API communication with authentication and role-based access controls.

### Devops

    Experience with container orchestration and deployments with pipelines to production on servers configured using nginx and portainer.
