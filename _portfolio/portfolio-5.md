Designed and developed a SaaS platform enabling users to upload and query various file types (PDFs, Word documents, audio, and images) using an AI assistant. Leveraged LangChain for data processing and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), integrating OpenAI's LLM models for contextual understanding. Built a scalable Python (FastAPI/Flask) backend to handle file processing, embedding generation, and conversational AI. Optimized PostgreSQL/Vector DBs (FAISS, ChromaDB, Weaviate) for semantic search and ensured secure API communication with authentication and role-based access controls.
